 **C. External opportunites that exist -
here are some ideas you may consider:
Opportunities like co-marketing (i.e. how your new headphones work great with nike shoes for a great workout)
funding opportunities you found (through government, VCs, Angel investors,etc), 
co-development possibilities with other companies  (maybe you can make a nike version of your headphones)
special conferences, trade meetings where you could present your product/service
give aways, hackathons, promotional deals, etc.
Give REAL ideas not fake ones.   Mention real companies and provide links to their homepage.   For venture capital (VC) give websites and discuss why THAT VC would be interested in YOUR startup (they specialize in human computing and your headphones would fit the profile of there past investments),  Special conferences & how they fit with YOUR product/service and give URL**
