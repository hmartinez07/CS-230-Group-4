# Item 1:

**A. Company Name of Ficticious Company (make it a name you would like --treat this like a real startup). Remember this must be a tech company.**
    
    1. Saefhoam
    
**B. Long-Term Vision Statement**
   
   1. what are the goals?
    
    Our company's goal is to find new ways to provide convience for our customer's home 
   
   2. where did your idea come from ( a class, a job, a need)?
      
    This idea came from the need of wanting a more comfortable life within our own home. 
    
   3. what is the purpose, values and mission? List 2 or 3 key questions that will guide the startup's choices. These should be essential questions that serve as touchstones to direct your companies efforts. For instance, how can the startup have impact? What engages our passions?
   
    1. How can we make our customer's home more convient? 2. What motivates us to come up with new ways into making our home lives easier? 
    
 **C. External opportunites that exist -
here are some ideas you may consider:
Opportunities like co-marketing (i.e. how your new headphones work great with nike shoes for a great workout)
funding opportunities you found (through government, VCs, Angel investors,etc), 
co-development possibilities with other companies  (maybe you can make a nike version of your headphones)
special conferences, trade meetings where you could present your product/service
give aways, hackathons, promotional deals, etc.
Give REAL ideas not fake ones.   Mention real companies and provide links to their homepage.   For venture capital (VC) give websites and discuss why THAT VC would be interested in YOUR startup (they specialize in human computing and your headphones would fit the profile of there past investments),  Special conferences & how they fit with YOUR product/service and give URL**

    1. Social Media: Facebook and Instagram promotions where we can post giveaways including items such as Roombas, vaccums, or appliances like mircorwaves or refigerators.
    2. Co-Marketing: Opportunities exist to co-market our product with home insurance providers such as StateFarm, Progressive, and Geico. (https://www.statefarm.com/, https://www.progressive.com/, https://www.geico.com/)
    3. Funding: A possible funder would be Google since they invested $450 million in ADT which is similar to the product that our company would be selling. (https://news.adt.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adt-announces-closing-450-million-investment-google#:~:text=BOCA%20RATON%2C%20Fla.%20%2C%20Sept,GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE)%20%2D%2D%20ADT%20Inc.). 
    4. Collaboration: Co-development with other companies such as Google to link our product with their software producing enhanced home safety and convenience.
